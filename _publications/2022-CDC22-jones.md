excerpt: 'We consider the specific problem of how the dynamics of networks can enact a representation of input stimuli that is retained over time, i.e., a form of short-term memory. We utilize modeling and control-theoretic methods to approach these questions, treating the state trajectory of a dynamical system as an abstract memory trace of prior inputs.'
