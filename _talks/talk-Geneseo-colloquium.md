<b>Abstract:</b> <br>
Modern imaging methods allow us to view the activity of tens of thousands of neurons in the brain. However, due to the large number of images to sort through, manual methods of location, identification, and analysis of these individual neurons is tedious and time-consuming. Researchers need an automated system to complete in hours what may take an expert weeks or even years. Some automated computer techniques exist, but they find only roughly half the cells, and disagree on half of what they find. Current leading methods analyze neural images using singular value decomposition and constrained non-negative matrix factorizations. We will compare the cells identified with these methods and improve them by i) developing new statistical criteria for identifying cells; ii) investigating correlation patterns across cells; and iii) aligning cells between recording sessions in order to compare cell activity across days.
