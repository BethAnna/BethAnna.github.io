Presentation of my initial PhD research, modeling a "gating policy" for optimal allocation of network resources to encoding and maintaining afferent stimuli. Given as a 15-minute virtual talk with [associated digital poster](https://brainmeeting2022.ipostersessions.com/?s=03-53-1A-15-CA-E7-58-4A-59-65-AC-C5-F8-D7-74-66).
