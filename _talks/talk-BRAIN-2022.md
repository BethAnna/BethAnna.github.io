**Abstract:** <br>
Working memory over short time-scales is regarded as a key component of fluid intelligence and is central to higher cognition. A major question in neuroscience pertains to how the architecture and dynamics of neural circuits enables the efficient encoding, retention, and eventual recall of such memories, especially in the face of complex and unpredictable multi-item memory tasks which we face on a daily basis. In this context, any successful mechanism for working memory must seemingly coordinate to embody the principles of (i) flexibility, allowing for new stimuli to be encoded accurately within its networks; as well as (ii) robustness, maintaining previous encodings for later recall. We consider the question of how neural circuits can embed the above functional principles. We adopt a top-down control theoretic framework with the goal of formally synthesizing network dynamics that extremize a mathematical objective corresponding to the two goals. We first model a collection of neural subnetwork slots as the state of the network, each able to hold a memory trace of an afferent stimulus over some characteristic time-constant. A new stimulus is gated onto these slots via a variable gain, whose specification is the crux of the memory encoding question. Through the optimization of the aforementioned mathematical objective, we are able to analytically specify the gating policy as a continuous process that is governed by subnetwork states, incoming stimuli, and an innate parameter of how the network 'decodes' its own activity. The result is an interconnected and biologically interpretable network architecture and dynamics that efficiently allocates mnemonic resources. We study this emergent network through a number of simulation studies, showing that it is indeed able to retain memory representation it is confronted with new and competing stimuli.
