This course focused on building a strong and rigorous foundation for students in practical engineering skills and knowledge, covering topics from software design and linear algebra to dynamical systems and modeling.

## Instructor, Fall 2024 
After my dissertation defense I acted as an adjunct instructor.  In this position, I managed everything for the smooth running of the course: I designed homework, labs, and case studies as well as their respective solutions; collaborated with the main instructor to accomplish pedagogical goals as well as occasionally lecture; coordinated and oversaw the team of undergraduate teaching assistants and graders; and worked with students directly in weekly office hours and coding lab sessions.

<!-- I also acted as a Teaching Assisstant (TA) for this course in Fall 2022 under the mentorship of Dr. ShiNung Ching. -->


## Teaching Assistant, Fall 2022
Weekly recitations; grading case studies; holding office hours.
