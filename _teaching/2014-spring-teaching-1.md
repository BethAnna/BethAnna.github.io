After my dissertation defense I acted as an adjunct instructor for a freshman-level course in Electrical & Systems Engineering. This course focused on building a strong foundation for students in practical engineering skills and knowledge, covering topics from software design and linear algebra to dynamical systems and modeling. In this position, I managed everything for the smooth running of the course: I designed homework, labs, and case studies as well as their respective solutions; collaborated with the main instructor to accomplish pedagogical goals as well as occasionally lecture; coordinated and oversaw the team of undergraduate teaching assistants and graders; and worked with students directly in weekly office hours and coding lab sessions.
