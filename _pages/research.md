My research 

I am particularly fascinated by how the complex dynamical activity of the human brain engenders our capacity to store, process, and manipulate a multitude of noisy information in real time. These cognitive functions –- collectively referred to as working memory –- empower learning, decision-making, and downstream cognition. Insight into these processes form the bedrock for understanding cognitive ability on a biological, physiological, and psychological basis, and consequently inform actionable approaches to not only patient care and mental health, but also the development of efficient and responsible AI, effective teaching, and more. 

As a systems engineer and applied mathematician by training, my research works to bridge the gap between neuroscience and engineering to gain mechanistic and systems-level understanding of neural function.


## Doctoral Research **(2019-2024)**
**Thesis:** <em>Synthesis of neuronal network dynamics for optimal stimulus encoding and retention.</em> <br>
**Advisor:** Dr. ShiNung Ching <br>
**Affiliation:** Department of Electrical & Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis <br>

  * Conducted PhD research in brain dynamics, using control-theoretical modeling and optimization to study neural mechansims of working memory and the role of attention. 
  * Characterized resulting network properties, architecture, and activity, and linked to popular theories of information encoding, processing, and retention in large-scale and biological networks. 
  * Dissertation defense completed August 27, 2024

## Undergraduate Research
### Undergraduate Researcher
**Title:** <em>[Eigenvalue Bounds on Regular Graphs](http://bethanna.github.io/2018-EigBounds-talk).</em> <br> 
**Advisor:** Dr. Cesar Aguilar <br> 
**Affiliation:** Department of Mathematics, State University of New York (SUNY) Geneseo <br>

  * Studied networks that have the same number of connections for each node (i.e., regular graphs). Established numerical bounds on these networks' characteristic second dominant eigenvalue, giving insight into related active topics of research in linear algebra and graph theory such as spectral gap, density, and structure.
  * Included independent research over the summer as well as regular group meetings during the semester, spanning my junior and senior years (2017 - 2019). Work presented at [multiple conferences](https://bethanna.github.io/cv/#talks). 
  

   
### Independent Study
**Title:** <em>[Describing Convex Polyhedral Growth.](http://bethanna.github.io/files/DescribingConvexPolyhedralGrowth.pdf)</em> <br> 
**Advisor:** Dr. Douglas Baldwin <br> 
**Affiliation:** Department of Mathematics, State University of New York (SUNY) Geneseo <br>

  * Developed algorithmic and mathematical models of crystal growth -- applicable to materials science, electronics, and pharmaceuticals alike. Completed Spring 2019 and presented results at SUNY Geneseo's GREAT Day 2019. 



### MSU Summer Undergraduate Research in Experimental Mathematics (SURIEM)
**Title:** <em>[Automated Image Analysis: Tracking Neural Activity.](http://bethanna.github.io/files/Tracking_Neural_Activity__Automated_Image_Analysis.pdf)</em> <br> 
**Advisor:** Dr. Mark Reimers <br>
