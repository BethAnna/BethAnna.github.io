**Thesis:** <em>Synthesis of neuronal network dynamics for optimal stimulus encoding and retention.</em> <br>
**Advisor:** Dr. ShiNung Ching <br>
**Affiliation:** Department of Electrical & Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis <br>

  * Designed constrained recurrent dynamical system models of neural circuits that embed functional principles
    * Framing open-ended real-world problems into well-defined control problems
  * Synthesized adaptive networks that evolve with contextual demands and optimize information coding using trained connections
    * (Non)linear optimization and control
    * Neural network AI
    * Pythonic simulation
    * Signal processing and representation
    * Proximal methods
    * Backpropagation
  * Characterized resulting network properties, architecture, and activity, and linked to popular theories of information encoding, processing, and retention in large-scale networks
    * Numerical and linear analysis
    * Data interpretation for real-world application and insight
  * Dissertation defense completed August 27, 2024
