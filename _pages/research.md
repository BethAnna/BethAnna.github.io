## Doctoral Research **(2019-2024)**
**Thesis:** <em>Synthesis of neuronal network dynamics for optimal stimulus encoding and retention.</em> <br>
**Advisor:** Dr. ShiNung Ching <br>
**Affiliation:** Department of Electrical & Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis <br>

  * Conducted PhD research in brain dynamics and controls, using theoretical modeling and optimization to study neural mechansims of working memory. 
  * Characterized resulting network properties, architecture, and activity, and linked to popular theories of information encoding, processing, and retention in large-scale networks
  * Dissertation defense completed August 27, 2024
