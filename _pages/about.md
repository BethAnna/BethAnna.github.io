Hello, I'm BethAnna! I am fascinated by the complex nature of the human brain and its capacity to store, process, and manipulate a multitude of noisy information in real time. These functions, collectively referred to as working memory, empower learning, decision-making, and downstream cognition. As an electrical and systems engineer by training, my work utilizes optimization and control-theoretic dynamical modeling to gain mechanistic and systems-level understanding of neural function. Check out my publications (or send me a message!) for more info. 

I also love to knit and crochet, and I am constantly working on new designs and projects. You can see those on [my Ravelry page](https://www.ravelry.com/designers/thompson-yarn-arts).  


<!--I am particularly interested in working memory and understanding how biological, physiological, and psychological differences engender disease.

<!--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i) how finite neural resources should be allocated to incoming stimuli for the ongoing management and temporary storage of stimuli for decision making and downstream cognition; \
<!--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) what network dynamics are associated with optimal gating of stimuli; and \
<!--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii) the interplay of working memory, including encoding and retention, with other key cognitive functions such as attention.
