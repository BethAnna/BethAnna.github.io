Hello! I'm BethAnna! 
I love using math and engineering as languages to describe natural phenomenoa and expand our knowledge about the world. I believe knowledge and hard work both _enable_ and _inspire_ innovative solutions to real-world problems, enacting positive change (be it big or small) in the everyday lives of us and our loved ones. This has been, and continues to be, my motivation for all I do.

I am particularly fascinated by how the complex dynamical activity of the human brain engenders our capacity to store, process, and manipulate a multitude of noisy information in real time. These cognitive functions -- collectively referred to as working memory -- empower learning, decision-making, and downstream cognition. Insight into these processes form the bedrock for understanding cognitive ability on a biological, physiological, and psychological basis, and consequently inform actionable approaches to not only patient care and mental health, but also the development of efficient and responsible AI, effective teaching, and more. 
As a systems engineer and applied mathematician by training, my research works to bridge the gap between neuroscience and engineering -- spanning optimization, control-theoretic dynamical modeling, software, and computational neuroscience -- to gain mechanistic and systems-level understanding of neural function. Check out my [CV](https://bethanna.github.io/cv/) and [Publications](https://bethanna.github.io/publications/) for more info. Or send me a message!  <br>

I also love to knit and crochet, and I am constantly working on new projects and designs. You can see those on [my Ravelry page](https://www.ravelry.com/designers/thompson-yarn-arts).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) what network dynamics are associated with optimal gating of stimuli; and \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii) the interplay of working memory, including encoding and retention, with other key cognitive functions such as attention. -->
