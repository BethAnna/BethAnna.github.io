  abstract = "A key question in the neuroscience of memory encoding pertains to
              the mechanisms by which afferent stimuli are allocated within
              memory networks. This issue is especially pronounced in the
              domain of working memory, where capacity is finite. Presumably
              the brain must embed some ``policy'' by which to allocate these
              mnemonic resources in an online manner in order to maximally
              represent and store afferent information for as long as possible
              and without interference from subsequent stimuli. Here, we engage
              this question through a top-down theoretical modeling framework.
              We formally optimize a gating mechanism that projects afferent
              stimuli onto a finite number of memory slots within a recurrent
              network architecture. In the absence of external input, the
              activity in each slot attenuates over time (i.e., a process of
              gradual forgetting). It turns out that the optimal gating policy
              consists of a direct projection from sensory activity to memory
              slots, alongside an activity-dependent lateral inhibition.
              Interestingly, allocating resources myopically (greedily with
              respect to the current stimulus) leads to efficient utilization
              of slots over time. In other words, later-arriving stimuli are
              distributed across slots in such a way that the network state is
              minimally shifted and so prior signals are minimally
              ``overwritten.'' Further, networks with heterogeneity in the
              timescales of their forgetting rates retain stimuli better than
              those that are more homogeneous. Our results suggest how online,
              recurrent networks working on temporally localized objectives
              without high-level supervision can nonetheless implement
              efficient allocation of memory resources over time.",
